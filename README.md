# Builda Pizza

### Running the code
```
yarn install
yarn start
```

### Some things I would add soon if this were the real deal
• Tests!  
• Linting  
• Improve the UI.  For example, something basic I'd do would be to allow the user to click the topping name, not just the topping checkbox.  Another example would be to better handle the alert that comes up when a user tries to select more toppings than a pizza will hold.  
• Make the number formatting more robust.  
• Make the page responsive, and of course make it look better.
