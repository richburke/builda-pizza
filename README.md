# Builda Pizza

### Running the code
```
yarn install
yarn test
```

### Some things I would add soon if this were the real deal
• Tests!
• Linting
• Improve the UI.  For example, something basic I'd do would be to allow the user to click the topping name, not just the topping checkbox.
• Make the number formatting more robust.
• Make the page responsive, and of course make it look better.
